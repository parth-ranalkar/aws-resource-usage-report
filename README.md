# aws-resource-usage-report

I developed a shell script that helps DevOps engineers track AWS resource usage and generate detailed reports. By scheduling the script with crontab, it runs automatically on a daily or weekly basis, depending on the specific requirements. This automation ensures regular monitoring and reporting without manual intervention.
